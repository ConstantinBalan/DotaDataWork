 Collaborative repository for working with Dota data to eventually train an AI model on

# ToResearch:
* Are there any trends in timings/items/objectives in different mmr categories?
* Can we use clustering to figure find mmr groups? Aka take all the data except the mmr and see if we can predict mmr groups
* Can we predict the most likely duration of a game? Based on what?
